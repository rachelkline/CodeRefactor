# CodeRefactor
Rachel Kline

In this assignment we were given some code and tasked with changing div tags to semantic tags. We want to leave everything looking exactly the way it is, however make it more accessable and more readable. The reason that we want to do this is because semantic tags are more descriptive. They are helpful for those who are vision impaired (or have other disabilities) that need a different way to access a web page.

I used a combination of header, section, aside, summary, and footer tags in order to complete this task. Alongside making the HTML more readable, I also cleaned up the CSS by combining elements that had the same properties such as color, weight, and size. I annotated where I made the changes and made sure that it didn't affect the original style of the website page.
